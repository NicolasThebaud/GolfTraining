## write an algorithm takes a sudoku grid, and outputs the solution
Every grid, given it's solvable, can be solved.

An empty grid is considered a viable input

If the input grid has multiple solutions, the output one can be any of those solutions.

_note: we suppose the input is a well formatted 9*9 Number array_
