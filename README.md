In this repo you won't find any articles about which driver club to chose or how to drive a golf cart. sorry.

What you will find is a collection of random algorithms
and their "golf", the minified version of the code (hand-made minification of course)

Note: none of the golf is meant to be "perfect"
any contribution for new challenges or better/shorter solutions is very welcome :)
